# Weather

This mod provides diverse weather for mapgen v5, v7 and a somewhat simpler weather for v6. Features include an API to add weather types and define the biome weather system. It will only work on Minetest versions greater than v5.0

The reason v6 maps are handled differently is due to the inability to detect the current biome of a players position, v6 maps report 'default' for every biome. Without any granularity the only possible detection is from the nodes around the player. I may add that level of detection, depending on demand.
